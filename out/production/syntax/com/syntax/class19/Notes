Access Morifiers in java:
-Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members(fields, methods, constructor etc)
and clasess itself in Java.
-There are 4 access levels and 3 keywords that we can use to define those access levels,
 forth level is applied when we dont use any keyword
 -Levels from most restricted to less are:
 1)Private(private is also keyword)
 2)Default(no keyword)
 3)Protected(protected keywoord)
 4)Public.(public keyword)
 -Rules
   1)we should always prefer private access modifier for fields.Because fields contain data
   and the methods of your class might use that data to preform some tasks, if we dont preform
   sanity checks before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods might
   misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not everyone can access the data
   ***A sanity check or sanity test is a basic test to quickly evaluate whether a claim
   or the result of a calculation can possibly be true. It is a simple check to see if the produced
   material is rational (that the material's creator was thinking rationally, applying sanity).
   2)We cant use access modifier with local variables. Because they live only inside certain
   block of code and for short period of time.
   **Fields should be 99% time private and methods should be public

 CONSTRUCTORS
 -constructors in java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class
 -Constructor is not a method (even though it has a lot of similarities with methods) it is block of code
 -if there is no constructor in the class, complier automaticlly creates a default constructor
 -Purpose of constructor is to give initial values to the fields of the class
