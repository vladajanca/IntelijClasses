Collections Frameworks in Java:
---Is a collections of classes that helps us manage and manipulate data in a better way
1)ArraysList
    --This class has many built-in methods like: add. remove, clear, ...
    --Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time
Syntax for ArraysList: ArrayList<> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList - name of the class
<> diamond operator we specify the data type

Wrapper classes:
byte=Byte
short=Short
int=Integer
double=Double
char=Character

Why we have wrraper classes?
--We get build in methods
--A lot of the frameworks dont support primitives
When to sue primitive?
--When we care about memory, because primitives occupy 4 times less memory than wrraper
--When we care about preformance
When to use Wrapper?
--when we want to easy manimulate and use data
