Method overloading in Java:
When same method name exist in a class but with different number of parameters or different datatype of parameters
or different sequence of parametars.

Advantages of method overloading:
1)Flexibility of having same name methods in a class
2)End User gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method names
Rules:
1)we can overload the constructors
2)we can overload the static methods as well
3)we can overload main method

Rules for static methods:
1)Static methods cant access instance fields directly
2)Instance methods can access instance as well static fields directly

Method overwriting:
1)Method overriding happens when we have a same name methods in parent and child class
2)We can overwrite method if we have inheretance relationship between two classes
3)We cant overwrite the private methods because they dont participate in inheritance
4)We cant overWrite constructor because they dont participate in inheritance
