Types of variables:
3 types of variables: local, instance and static;

-local variables:
if variable is define inside a method or loop or switch or any other block
of code it is called local variable.
-instance variables:
if variable is not define inside a method but it is inside a class then
it is called an instance variable
-Static variable:
if variable is not declared inside a method but it is
 inside a class and it has static keyword with it then it is called a static variable
 When to use which type of variables:

 Local variables:
 PROS: Save memory
 CONS: Not accesable out of Methods/block of code
 Should always be preferd over instance and static variables
 why because they occupy comp memory for very short period of time
 sa sook as the purpose is served java destroys them.

 Instance variables:
 PROS: Accesable in all of the methods of a class
 CONS: Occupy comp memory for longer then local
 when we want to share somethig in multiple methods of a class and the information is expected to be
 different from object to object we shuld go with instance variablse.

 Static Variables:
 PROS: Single memory location for all object of the class
 CONS:1Stay longer in the memory 2Can hold only one value at the time
 When we know taht info will stay the same for all the objects of the class we should create
 a static variable for that
