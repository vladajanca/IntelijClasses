Super Keyword:
"super" is a keyword like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object.
We can use super in 3 diferent ways.
1) To access the super class variables if we have same name variables in super class
and base class.
2)if we have same method namse in parent and child class we can use super keyword to access
the parent class method, otherwise by default java refers to the child class method
3)As constractor dont participate in inheritance we can use super() to call the
constructor from parent class
Rules:
if we have constructor in parent class that take 2 arguments we must have a constructor inside a child class
that at least takes those 2 arguments
2)we cant use this() and super() inside the same constructor.
3)super cant be used in static methods

Method overloading in Java
if we have same name method in the class with different number of parameters or diferent
sequence of parameters or different datatypes of the parameters it is called METHOD OVERLOADING.
class calculator{
void add(int number1, int number2){

}
void add(int number, int number1, int number2){

}
void add(int number,int numebr1, int number3){

}
We can overload methods only if we change number of parametars, sequence of parametars
