Inheretance in Java:
Its a mechanisam in java where a child class inherit the properties of a parent class.
     Benefits of inheretance class:
1)Saves time to code
2)Code duplication is reduced
3)execution time is faster
     Disadventages of inheretance:
1)Classes are tightly coupled if we change somethig in parent class it is also changed in the child class.
     Types of inheretance: there are 4 types but java only support 3 of them
1)Single inheretance - in single inheretance we have only one child and one parent class
2)Hierarchical - 1 parent class more then 1 child clasess
3)Multilevel - multiple levels of inheretance for example A B C, Class C will be inhernt from B and B class will be inherent from C
4)Multiple(is not supported in Java)

Super Keyword:
Super keyword is like "this", it refers to the parent class object, for example
we can access the fields method or constructors of parent class inside the child class using super keyword
