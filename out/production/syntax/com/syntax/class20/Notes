Constructors in Java:
   Constructors in Java are special block of code similar to methods that initialize the object in of the class
Rules:
   1)they dont have writen types, not even void
   2)Name of constructor must be sam as name of the class
   3)Constructors cant have non access modifiers like static, final etc
   4)We can use the access modifiers like public, private, protected with constructor
   5)If we dont write constructor in the class a default constructor is provided by compiler
   6)We can have multiply constructors in the class but their number of arguments sequence of argument, type of argument shuld be different
   7)If multiple constructors, then Java decide which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass.
this keword:
   it is a reserved keyword in Java taht we can use to refer to instance variables, methods or constructorof a class
   1)this keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables
   2)We can use "this" keyword to call the constructor of a class
   3)We can use "this" keyword to call the methods of the class
Rulse for this()
