Abstraction in Java:
   Hiding the implementation detals and providing the functionality only.
Two methods to achive abstraction:
   1)Abstract classes
   2)Interfaces
--Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword.
--Interfaces are the contract that we created with the help of interface keyword
How to decide abstract or interface?
1)We should prefer interface over abstract
2)--If 2 or more classes are closely related to each other go with abstract classes
e.g if we have to create a Lion class and Horse class we should go with abstract to create an animal class
  --if 2 classes are not related to each other e.g Apple and Cloth class we should create an interface

Encapsulation:
It is the forth pillar if OOPS. it provides security and better control over the data of a class.
We create a classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods.
theese methods are called  GETTER SETTER METHODS and we set and get the value of the class fields
with the help of these methods instead accessing and  modifing them directly.
