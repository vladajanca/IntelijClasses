PROS: Save memory
CONS: Limited access can not be access out of method or block of code where they are declared

Instance:
The variables which are declared inside a class but out of methodor block of code

ACCESS MODIFIERS

Access modifiers are keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable, method, class etc
can be accessed.

There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using three keywords
keywords are:
1)Private
2)Protected
3)Public

type of access are:
1)Private(keyword is private)
2)Default(applied when no keyword is used)
3)Protected (protected class)
4)Public (Public keyword)

1)Private access
When we use private keyword with any of th variables, methods or classes
these can only be accessed within that class.

2)Default access
When we dont use any of the keywords default is applied by java to those variables, methods or clases
which means these can only be accessed from the same package.

3)Protected access
When protected access is applies calss members(variablse, methods etc.) can be accessed
from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance

4)Public access:
Public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that
project.
